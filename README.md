<h1>CallForce Dr Profile Demo 📆</h1>
<p>
This is a small, over-engineered application aimed to complete the code assessment for CallForce. More importantly, it would serve as a model for building a much larger scale application with the technologies listed belowed. Or rather, one approach for how one could go about creating a larger scale application suited for handling scheduling asynchronously with a supported app state like redux.
