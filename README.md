<h1>CallForce Dr Profile Demo 📆</h1>
<p>
This is a small, over-engineered application aimed to complete the code assessment for CallForce. More importantly, it could ostensisbly serve as a model for building a much larger scale application with the technologies listed belowed. Or rather, it could serve as one approach for how one could go about creating a larger scale application suited for handling scheduling asynchronously with a supported app state like redux.
</p>
<h3>A few notes:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>controller/dentistController has a json object serving as a simulated database object</li>
    <li>This is a basic setup with a lot of techs - the architecture of a much larger scale would require route configuration and container setup accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Installation 💻:</h1>
<ul>
    <li>git clone this repo</li>
    <li>npm i</li>
    <li>npm start</li>
    <li>(in second terminal) nodemon (https://nodemon.io/)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Technologies 👨‍💻:</h1>
<p>
As mentioned above, this demo is over-engineered. I am using the following front-end technologies:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>React.js</li>
    <li>React-Bootstrap</li>
    <li>FullCalendar (learn more @ https://fullcalendar.io/docs#toc)</li>
    <li>React-DatePicker</li>
    <li>React-Time-Picker</li>
    <li>Redux</li>
    <li>React-Redux</li>
    <li>Redux-Thunk (middleware for handling async functions as opposed to returning an object for action creators - Learn more @ https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk</li>
    <li>immutability-helper (learn more @ https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper)</li>
</ul>
<p>For backend technologies:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Node</li>
    <li>Express</li>
</ul>
<p>For handling the service calls:</p>
<ul>
